- **Composable** (Choice of the network plugin for instance)
- Supports most popular **Linux distributions**
- **Continuous integration tests**

## Quick Start

Below are several ways to use Kubespray to deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

### Ansible

#### Usage

Install Ansible according to [Ansible installation guide](/docs/ansible.md#installing-ansible)
then run the following steps:

```ShellSession
# Copy ``inventory/sample`` as ``inventory/mycluster``
cp -rfp inventory/sample inventory/mycluster

# Update Ansible inventory file with inventory builder
declare -a IPS=(10.10.1.3 10.10.1.4 10.10.1.5)
CONFIG_FILE=inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml python3 contrib/inventory_builder/inventory.py ${IPS[@]}

# Review and change parameters under ``inventory/mycluster/group_vars``
cat inventory/mycluster/group_vars/all/all.yml
cat inventory/mycluster/group_vars/k8s_cluster/k8s-cluster.yml

# Clean up old Kubernetes cluster with Ansible Playbook - run the playbook as root
# The option `--become` is required, as for example cleaning up SSL keys in /etc/,
# uninstalling old packages and interacting with various systemd daemons.
# Without --become the playbook will fail to run!
# And be mind it will remove the current kubernetes cluster (if it's running)!
ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml  --become --become-user=root reset.yml

# Deploy Kubespray with Ansible Playbook - run the playbook as root
# The option `--become` is required, as for example writing SSL keys in /etc/,
# installing packages and interacting with various systemd daemons.
# Without --become the playbook will fail to run!
ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml  --become --become-user=root cluster.yml
```

Note: When Ansible is already installed via system packages on the control node,
Python packages installed via `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` will go to
a different directory tree (e.g. `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` on
Ubuntu) from Ansible's (e.g. `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible` still on
Ubuntu). As a consequence, the `ansible-playbook` command will fail with:

```raw
ERROR! no action detected in task. This often indicates a misspelled module name, or incorrect module path.
```

This likely indicates that a task depends on a module present in ``requirements.txt``.

One way of addressing this is to uninstall the system Ansible package then
reinstall Ansible via ``pip``, but this not always possible and one must
take care regarding package versions.
A workaround consists of setting the `ANSIBLE_LIBRARY`
and `ANSIBLE_MODULE_UTILS` environment variables respectively to
the `ansible/modules` and `ansible/module_utils` subdirectories of the ``pip``
installation location, which is the ``Location`` shown by running
`pip show [package]` before executing `ansible-playbook`.

A simple way to ensure you get all the correct version of Ansible is to use
the [pre-built docker image from Quay](https://quay.io/repository/kubespray/kubespray?tab=tags).
You will then need to use [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/)
to access the inventory and SSH key in the container, like this:

```ShellSession
git checkout v2.24.1
docker pull quay.io/kubespray/kubespray:v2.24.1
docker run --rm -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/inventory/sample,dst=/inventory \
  --mount type=bind,source="${HOME}"/.ssh/id_rsa,dst=/root/.ssh/id_rsa \
  quay.io/kubespray/kubespray:v2.24.1 bash
# Inside the container you may now run the kubespray playbooks:
ansible-playbook -i /inventory/inventory.ini --private-key /root/.ssh/id_rsa cluster.yml
```

#### Collection

See [here](docs/ansible_collection.md) if you wish to use this repository as an Ansible collection

### Vagrant

For Vagrant we need to install Python dependencies for provisioning tasks.
Check that ``Python`` and ``pip`` are installed:

```ShellSession
python -V && pip -V
```

If this returns the version of the software, you're good to go. If not, download and install Python from here <https://www.python.org/downloads/source/>

Install Ansible according to [Ansible installation guide](/docs/ansible.md#installing-ansible)
then run the following step:

```ShellSession
vagrant up
```

Note: Upstart/SysV init based OS types are not supported.

## Container Runtime Notes

- Supported Docker versions are 18.09, 19.03, 20.10, 23.0 and 24.0. The *recommended* Docker version is 24.0. `Kubelet` might break on docker's non-standard version numbering (it no longer uses semantic versioning). To ensure auto-updates don't break your cluster look into e.g. the YUM  ``versionlock`` plugin or ``apt pin``).
- The cri-o version should be aligned with the respective kubernetes version (i.e. kube_version=1.20.x, crio_version=1.20)

## Requirements

- **Minimum required version of Kubernetes is v1.27**
- **Ansible v2.14+, Jinja 2.11+ and python-netaddr is installed on the machine that will run Ansible commands**
- The target servers must have **access to the Internet** in order to pull docker images. Otherwise, additional configuration is required (See [Offline Environment](docs/offline-environment.md))
- The target servers are configured to allow **IPv4 forwarding**.
- If using IPv6 for pods and services, the target servers are configured to allow **IPv6 forwarding**.
- The **firewalls are not managed**, you'll need to implement your own rules the way you used to.
    in order to avoid any issue during deployment you should disable your firewall.
- If kubespray is run from non-root user account, correct privilege escalation method
    should be configured in the target servers. Then the `ansible_become` flag
    or command parameters `--become or -b` should be specified.

Hardware:
These limits are safeguarded by Kubespray. Actual requirements for your workload can differ. For a sizing guide go to the [Building Large Clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/cluster-large/#size-of-master-and-master-components) guide.

- Master
  - Memory: 1500 MB
- Node
  - Memory: 1024 MB

## Ingress Plugins

- [nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx): the NGINX Ingress Controller.

- [metallb](docs/metallb.md): the MetalLB bare-metal service LoadBalancer provider.
