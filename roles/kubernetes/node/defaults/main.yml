# IP address of the DNS server.
# Kubernetes will create a pod with several containers, serving as the DNS
# server and expose it under this IP address. The IP address must be from
# the range specified as kube_service_addresses. This magic will actually
# pick the 10th ip address in the kube_service_addresses range and use that.
